## Configurable Application for Measurements, Experiments and Laboratory Systems  

NOMAD CAMELS is a configurable measurement software, targeted towards the requirements of experimental solid-state physics. Here many experiments utilize a multitude of measurement devices used in dynamically changing setups. CAMELS allows to define instrument control and measurement protocols using a graphical user interface (GUI). This provides a low entry threshold enabling the creation of new measurement protocols without programming knowledge or a deeper understanding of device communication. The GUI generates python code that interfaces with instruments and allows users to modify the code for specific applications and implementations of arbitrary instruments if necessary. Even large-scale distributed systems can be implemented. CAMELS generates FAIR-compliant data including rich metadata. NeXus standards, immediate NOMAD integration and hence a FAIRmat-compliant data pipeline can be readily implemented.

## 1.4.0 API improvements, clean protocol exit, more metadata

Features:
- Added a **new** protocol step called `API Call`. This step allows you the user to call other APIs via HTTP requests. There is native support for CAMELS API calls. Results returned by the API calls can then be used in the following steps.
- CAMELS API server now accessible from network. (Changed host setting to `0.0.0.0`)
- CAMELS API now lets you get a JSON string containing the protocol and all its settings
- CAMELS API now lets you get a JSON string containing the current CAMELS settings.
- A protocol to execute at the end of a protocol, no matter wether it finishes correctly or breaks can now be added
- Instruments can now get metadata from ELNs

Changes:
- Renamed `comment / uncomment` to `enable / disable` for protocol steps to make it more clear
- Data passing from the Execute Python Script step was changed. Now should be more stable, as it looks for the Data between the `###Start Data` und `###End Data` strings. See our [documentation](https://fau-lap.github.io/NOMAD-CAMELS/doc/protocol_steps/step_Execute_Python_File.html#returning-results) for more details.
- Refactored the way metadata is saved in instruments

Fixes:
- fixed a bug where a protocol would show multiple times
- installed version should now be found correctly when searching for updates
- removing / moving of buttons in tabs fixed
- requirement updated to camels suitcase 0.2.2, fixing datasets in instruments
- some raised exceptions now provide additional traceback
- errors raised by plots now only raised once, not for each datapoint
- number of datapoints set in plot definition now correctly taken over to plot
- fixed a bug that would stop users from logging in to the central NOMAD
- logging used a bad file handler that would stop logs, now corrected

---

### 1.3.1

Features:
- API: Now adds a UUID to all protocol executions performed via API. Allows you to track and retrieve the results of each protocol run.
- Set Value Popup step now allows to define comboboxes
- Can allow prompt step to abort protocol now

Changes:
- Resetting positions for plots at each run, hoping to keep plots visible for remote-sessions
- Allowed for stopping a protocol during instrument instantiation

Fixes:
- Removed unnecessary import in protocols
- Having quotation marks in a prompt or a step description could break the protocol, now fixed
- Fixed tabs on first startup of CAMELS
- Fixed naming of empty tabs

- Making new preset now actually loads said one and does not overwrite the old one
- API: Fixed changing variables of protocols already added to the queue
- API: You can now use negative index in the API calls
- Evaluator does not break on non-string inputs, but simply returns them
- Fixed different read-channel steps when using a subprotocol
- fixed subprotocol evaluator not updating
- fixed usage of quotation marks for advanced instrument config step
- when switching the preset, the tabs now load correctly
- tab order is now remembered
- log plots might not show correctly, now they have a minimum size
- quotation mark problems with protocol overview fixed
- links now open correctly on unix and mac
- ctrl+v now works in container-steps
- should now correctly handle /gui urls for NOMAD oasis
- ElapsedTime now displays correctly in plots
- Adding while-loop counter earlier to namespace so it can be part of the while condition
- fixed a bug where a short queued protocol would be run endlessly
- when the most recent preset was no viable json, it might break camels, now the second newest will be loaded instead of breaking

## 1.3.0 API and Watchdogs

Major Features:
- Added an API web server. The homepage `http:\\localhost:<PORT>` gives you an overview of the available API calls and how to use them. You need to create an API key in the settings to be able to use most of the API calls. You can get a list of the available protocols you can execute with `GET /protocols` and run a specific protocol by using `POST /protocols/{protocol_name}` For more information check the documentation.
- Added a Watchdog feature to monitor certain values and execute operations when their condition is met.

Features:
- The `Execute Python Files` step passes the current value of variables passed to the script if no value is entered in the `value` field.
- "Shared" scope now possible in NOMAD sample selection
- Added more metadata to instruments in the data

Changes:
- Variable signal is now saved as group instead of dataset

Fixes:
- Can now save variables with non-scalar size
- x-y plot now working with array-data again
- Multiple occurances of same protocol in tab-dictionary in save-json removed

- Fixed bug where a custom function signal that does not use force-sequential would not work
- Fixed bug that prevented fits from being displayed if the fit had many variables
- Number of databroker files setting never did anything, now it does
- Would upload wrong file to NOMAD if always new file

### 1.2.2
Features:
- Included the protocol's json used by the configuration in CAMELS into the data file
- Added functionality to replace loopsteps (instead of delete + add a new one)
- Included exception handling for manual control threads and allow for restarting them on error
- Added a progress bar functionality for the wait-step
- Added conditional waiting to the wait-step
- More info on python file step in protocol overview

Fixes:

### 1.2.1
Features:

- Fixed bug that prevented the app from starting when no tabs were used before
- Fixed issue with dots in paths

## 1.2.0

Features:
- Data can now be exported to hdf5 during the measurement. This should remove long waiting times after running protocols with lots of data.
- Added a filter functionality to the right-click menu when setting channels or variables. This filters all available channels, variables or functions by the string that is entered.
- Added the `Execute Python File` loop step. This allows the user to specify a Python file and a Python environment to run the file with. The environment can either be the same as the one running CAMELS (default), a different already existing one, or is created dynamically by giving it the required packages and versions. The Python file can return (realized by printing) a dictionary with key value pairs. To read these, give the name of the key in the `Values returned by the Python file` list.
- Added a tab that allows you to add new tabs simply by clicking it.
- Point Distance can now be used for For-loops.

Changes:
- Running a protocol with a subprotocol also builds the subprotocol now. This makes it easier to change sub-protocols for more complex measurement routines.
- start-min-max-stop sweeps in a for loop now behave differently, the number of points is now the total number of points, not the number between min and max

Fixes:
- Description fields now change their size dynamically.
- Filtering the channels by name does not break if no matches were found.
- Filtering Set Channels now does not reset the value if the channel does not match the query.
- Fixed the hide/show information when installing instruments
