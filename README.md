## Configurable Application for Measurements, Experiments and Laboratory Systems  

NOMAD CAMELS is a configurable measurement software, targeted towards the requirements of experimental solid-state physics. Here many experiments utilize a multitude of measurement devices used in dynamically changing setups. CAMELS allows to define instrument control and measurement protocols using a graphical user interface (GUI). This provides a low entry threshold enabling the creation of new measurement protocols without programming knowledge or a deeper understanding of device communication. The GUI generates python code that interfaces with instruments and allows users to modify the code for specific applications and implementations of arbitrary instruments if necessary. Even large-scale distributed systems can be implemented. CAMELS generates FAIR-compliant data including rich metadata. NeXus standards, immediate NOMAD integration and hence a FAIRmat-compliant data pipeline can be readily implemented.

# Changelog

### 1.8.0 Parallel Async Reading and New Plot Backend

Features:
- can now asynchronously read channels during a running protocol

Changes:
- Plots now use a different backend. Should make the run engine faster and more stable. Plots now run in their own threads and should not interefere as much with the main protocol execution.
- Now saves data files with an `.h5` file extension if no NeXus output was enabled. Only uses `.nxs` file extension if NeXus output is saved to the file. Should clarify that the standard CAMELS data files do **NOT** follow rigid NeXus standards.

Fixed:
- You can now run the same subprotocol multiple times. Each subprotocol execution creates it own data stream. This means the datafile has separate entires for each subprotocol run
- When dragging / dropping a step in the protocol sequence, the moved step is now selected afterwards
- Cannot drop a step in a simple sweep anymore
- Manual controls could not work with channels that need to call trigger, now fixed
- Made aborting a protocol more stable
- Generic set and read manual control now closes its thread more stably
- Fixed expression evaluation for subprotocols
- Protocol and device description field is now max 130px high. After that it becomes scrollable.

### 1.7.2

Features:
- Can now break loops in the if-step
- Can now play a sound effect (select checkbox in settings) when protocol is doen

- Progress bar in wait sometimes crashed, now fixed
- Updated custom function signal to better support list / tuple ... setting-types by handling kwargs from bluesky
- Made plotting much more robust. You can now define multiple plots and read at multiple points in your protocol. The plots are only updated if data concerning the y-axis of your plot is actually read.
- Updating instrument never worked, only installing, now fixed
- Update all instruments now skips local drivers
- Users and samples are now saved in a more robust way

Fixed:
- ElapsedTime for List and 2D plots fixed
- Not necessary to read channels when waiting for condition anymore (condition might be due to variable for example)
- Driver builder does not create read-functions for set-channels anymore
- List-plot can now display other types than numbers and bool again
- Throwing an error when trying to execute python file without specifying a file
- Variables in protocols run by a watchdog should now work

## 1.5.0 metadata structuring

Features:
There is a new data output structure, making it clearer to understand, mostly consistent with old versions.
The data / metadata are not saved in a rigid NeXus shape anymore. However, it is possible (turned on by default) to add the NX structure as an additional entry in the hdf5. If doing this, the data is not duplicated, everything is done by soft-links in the hdf5.

Fixed:
- Can now paste again with ctrl+v in most outer part of protocol
- Fixed throwing errors when entering bad values in variable-boxes
- Removed additional appearance of plot_data in metadata

## 1.4.0 API improvements, clean protocol exit, more metadata

Features:
- Added a **new** protocol step called `API Call`. This step allows you the user to call other APIs via HTTP requests. There is native support for CAMELS API calls. Results returned by the API calls can then be used in the following steps.
- CAMELS API server now accessible from network. (Changed host setting to `0.0.0.0`)
- CAMELS API now lets you get a JSON string containing the protocol and all its settings
- CAMELS API now lets you get a JSON string containing the current CAMELS settings.
- A protocol to execute at the end of a protocol, no matter wether it finishes correctly or breaks can now be added
- Instruments can now get metadata from ELNs

Changes:
- Renamed `comment / uncomment` to `enable / disable` for protocol steps to make it more clear
- Data passing from the Execute Python Script step was changed. Now should be more stable, as it looks for the Data between the `###Start Data` und `###End Data` strings. See our [documentation](https://fau-lap.github.io/NOMAD-CAMELS/doc/protocol_steps/step_Execute_Python_File.html#returning-results) for more details.

## 1.3.0 API and Watchdogs

Major Features:
- Added an API web server. The homepage `http:\\localhost:<PORT>` gives you an overview of the available API calls and how to use them. You need to create an API key in the settings to be able to use most of the API calls. You can get a list of the available protocols you can execute with `GET /protocols` and run a specific protocol by using `POST /protocols/{protocol_name}` For more information check the documentation.
- Added a Watchdog feature to monitor certain values and execute operations when their condition is met.

Features:

## 1.2.0

Features:
- Data can now be exported to hdf5 during the measurement. This should remove long waiting times after running protocols with lots of data.
- Added a filter functionality to the right-click menu when setting channels or variables. This filters all available channels, variables or functions by the string that is entered.
- Added the `Execute Python File` loop step. This allows the user to specify a Python file and a Python environment to run the file with. The environment can either be the same as the one running CAMELS (default), a different already existing one, or is created dynamically by giving it the required packages and versions. The Python file can return (realized by printing) a dictionary with key value pairs. To read these, give the name of the key in the `Values returned by the Python file` list.
- Added a tab that allows you to add new tabs simply by clicking it.
- Point Distance can now be used for For-loops.

Changes:
- Running a protocol with a subprotocol also builds the subprotocol now. This makes it easier to change sub-protocols for more complex measurement routines.
- Start-min-max-stop sweeps in a for loop now behave differently, the number of points is now the total number of points, not the number between min and max

Fixed:
- Description fields now change their size dynamically.
- Filtering the channels by name does not break if no matches were found.
- Filtering Set Channels now does not reset the value if the channel does not match the query.
- Fixed the hide/show information when installing instruments
