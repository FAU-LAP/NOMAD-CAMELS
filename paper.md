# Summary

NOMAD-CAMELS is a configurable measurement software, targeted towards the requirements of experimental solid-state physics. Here many experiments utilize a multitude of measurement devices used in dynamically changing setups. CAMELS will allow to define instrument control and measurement protocols using a graphical user interface (GUI). This provides a low entry threshold enabling the creation of new measurement protocols without programming knowledge or a deeper understanding of device communication. The GUI generates python code that interfaces with instruments and allows users to modify the code for specific applications and implementations of arbitrary devices if necessary. Even large-scale, distributed systems can be implemented. CAMELS is well suited to generate FAIR-compliant output data. Nexus standards, immediate NOMAD integration and hence a FAIRmat compliant data pipeline can be readily implemented.

# Statement of need

In experimental physics many home-built, ad hoc measurement setups are used. Typically, a specific software is written to control each of these setups. Although there are already tools available (e.g. "SweepMe!" [@SweepMe]) to realise the control of different measurement instruments, they are usually not open source and their data output is not compliant to the FAIR principles [@Wilkinson2016].

With NOMAD CAMELS we develop a tool that is completely free to use for everybody and collects all the metadata of experiment, known to the computer, automatically for each measurement. By providing an easy to use graphical user interface, NOMAD CAMELS allows the collection of data and rich metadata even without programming knowledge. With the default output as a structured .hdf5 file, NOMAD CAMELS' measurement data stays as close to the NeXus format [@Konnecke2015] as possible, while staying agnostic of the measurement itself, complying with the FAIR principles.

Furthermore, NOMAD CAMELS provides a direct connection to NOMAD [@Draxl2019] (or NOMAD Oasis, a local installation) to make use of electronic lab notebook (ELN) features. The user can select sample-data from NOMAD to connect with the measurement and directly upload the measured data, providing a simple and fast workflow in the lab.

# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.

# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
