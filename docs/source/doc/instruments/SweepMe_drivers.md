# SweepMe! devices

NOMAD CAMELS provides a wrapper for the vast library of device drivers from [SweepMe!](https://sweep-me.net/)

## How to use

To use the drivers, you need to download them from [SweepMe!](https://sweep-me.net/devices) or get them from their [GitHub page](https://github.com/SweepMe/instrument-drivers).

In the instrument management in NOMAD CAMELS you then need to select the path to the SweepMe! driver. The driver's possible settings are then loaded into the config window.

If the drivers do not work, the drivers might need additional python packages that do not come with NOMAD CAMELS. Please refer to the respective device's page on the [SweepMe! website](https://sweep-me.net/devices).
