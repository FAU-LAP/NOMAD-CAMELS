# CAMELS Installation

As NOMAD-CAMELS (from now on only 'CAMELS') is written in python it requires a working python environment to run properly.

If you do not have python installed on your machine or a clean python environment you have several options:
1. [Using the installer](installation_installer.md) (**RECOMMENDED when using Windows**!)
2. Custom installation for [Windows](installation_custom_windows.md), [UNIX](installation_custom_unix.md), and [macOS](installation_custom_macos.md)
3. [Installation using Anaconda](installation_custom_anaconda/installation_custom_anaconda.md)
