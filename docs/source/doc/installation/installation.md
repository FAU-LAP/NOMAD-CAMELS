# CAMELS Installation

CAMELS is written in Python and requires the correct Python environment to run properly.

In the most basics cases a simple installation using _pip_ is sufficient. To install CAMELS to an existing Python environment (must be Python version 3.9.6 or newer) simply run

```bash
pip install nomad-camels
```
