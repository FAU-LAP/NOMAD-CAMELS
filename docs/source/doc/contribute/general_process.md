# Welcome to CAMELS Guide for Contributing

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

Read our [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.


## Create a new issue
If you spot a problem with CAMELS, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/FAU-LAP/NOMAD-CAMELS/issues).

## Make Changes
There are two ways in which you can contribute to the CAMELS project.
### 1. Add New Instrument Drivers
If you have developed a new instrument for CAMELS research, it can be easily added to the existing instrument drivers in our [driver repository](https://github.com/FAU-LAP/CAMELS_drivers). 
### 2. Modify the CAMELS Source Code
Any one can help make CAMELS better by adding new functionality or improving existing code. 

---

Both ways of contributing to the CAMELS project require you to follow these simple steps:

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) the repository.
2. Create a working branch and start with your changes!
3. Make modifications to the repository, like adding a new instrument driver or enhancing CAMELS.
4. Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Keep in mind to name your commits in an understandable way as this makes reviewing your code much easier.
5. When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request.
6. Don't forget to [link](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) PR to issue if you are solving one.
7. The CAMELS development team will then review your pull request and may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

**If your contribution was successfully reviewed your pull request will be merged.** &#127881;
