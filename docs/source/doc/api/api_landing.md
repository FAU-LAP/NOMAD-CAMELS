# CAMELS API

The CAMELS API (starting with CAMELS version 1.3.0) allows you to interact with the opened CAMELS software. You can for example ask for all the current protocols and execute an already defined protocol. This allows you to integrate CAMELS with already existing control software.

CAMELS API uses a web server running on the machines `//localhost:`. You interact with the API by sending http requests to the web server.
