# Deleting API Keys

You can delete **all** API keys by clicking the red `Delete ALL API keys` button in the settings window. You can not delete individual API keys.

```{attention}
You can not revert deleting the API keys! Any existing software relying on the API keys in the database file will break! You will have to create new API keys afterward and give them to the other software again.
```

It might make sense in some situations to periodically update the API keys to have a clearer understanding of who is using API keys.
