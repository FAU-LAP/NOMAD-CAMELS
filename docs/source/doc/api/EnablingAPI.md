# Enabling the API

You can enable CAMELS API under `File -> Settings`. Check the box `Enable API` and enter a valid port that is not being used by other software on your computer (try something like `5000`). CAMELS will create the API web server and start it as soon as you click `OK` and exit the settings window.

```{note}
The server will automatically startup with CAMELS if you have `Enable API` checked.
```
