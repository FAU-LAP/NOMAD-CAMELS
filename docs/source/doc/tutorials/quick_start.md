<!-- 
### How to Add and Configure Instruments

The easiest way to get comfortable with CAMELS is to first learn [how to add and configure](quick_start_install.md) already implemented instruments.

---

### How to Setup Measurement Protocols

Learn how to [setup measurement protocols](quick_start_protocols.md). Use the instruments you configured in measurement sequences.

---

### Protocol Steps Explained

You can learn which protocol steps exists and how to use them [here](../protocol_steps/protocol_steps_landing.md). Protocol steps are the actions you can perform during a measurement sequence, like setting and reading an instrument channel, or creating a loop, waiting for a specified time, 

---

### How to Use the CAMELS API

If you want to control your CAMELS software with another program you can use [CAMELS' API](../api/api_landing.md). This is especially useful if you have existing scripts but now want to control specific (new) aspects with CAMELS while still using the script you already have.

---

### List of Available Instruments

[Here](../instruments/instruments.rst) you find a list of available instruments that are already implemented.

---

### How to Write New Drivers for Your Instruments

You can add your own instruments that have not yet been implemented by writing your **own drivers**.

You can follow our [step-by-step guide](../programmers_guide/drivers/drivers_tutorial.md) for writing drivers or start with the [new driver documentation](../programmers_guide/instrument_drivers.md) directly. -->
