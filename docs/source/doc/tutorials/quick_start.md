# Getting Started
This guide should help you to get to know the main features of NOMAD-CAMELS (short: CAMELS) after a successful [installation](../installation/installation.md).

The easiest way to get comfortable with CAMELS is to first learn [how to add and configure](quick_start_install.md) already implemented instruments. Then how to [use them in measurement protocols](quick_start_protocols.md). 

You can then add your own instruments that have not been implemented yet by [writing your own drivers](../programmers_guide/instrument_drivers.md).
