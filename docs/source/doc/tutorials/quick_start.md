# Getting Started

After successful [installation](../installation/installation.md) of CAMELS you are ready to start your experiments.

## How to Add and Configure Instruments

The easiest way to get comfortable with CAMELS is to first learn [how to add and configure](quick_start_install.md) already implemented instruments.

## How to Setup Measurement Protocols

Then learn how to [use instruments in measurement protocols](quick_start_protocols.md). 

## Protocol Steps Explained

You can learn which protocol steps exists and how to use them [here](../protocol_steps/protocol_steps_landing.md).

## Hot to Use the CAMELS API

If you want to control your CAMELS software with another program you can use [CAMELS' API](../api/api_landing.md). This is especially useful if you have existing scripts but now want to control specific (new) aspects with CAMELS while still using the script you already have.

## List of Available Instruments

[Here](../instruments/instruments.rst) you find a list of available instruments that are already implemented.

## How to Write New Drivers for Your Instruments

You can add your own instruments that have not yet been implemented by writing your **own drivers**.

You can follow our [step-by-step guide](../programmers_guide/drivers/drivers_tutorial.md) for writing drivers or start with the [new driver documentation](../programmers_guide/instrument_drivers.md) directly.
