# Getting Started
This guide should help you to get to know the main features of NOMAD-CAMELS (short: CAMELS) after a successful [installation](../installation/installation.md).

```{tip}
The easiest way to get comfortable with CAMELS is to first learn [how to add and configure](quick_start_install.md) already implemented instruments.
```

```{tip}
 Then learn how to [use instruments in measurement protocols](quick_start_protocols.md). 
```

---

Do you want to use CAMELS but for the instruments you have in your lab you can not find appropriate drivers?

```{tip}
You can add your own instruments that have not been implemented yet by [writing your own drivers](../programmers_guide/instrument_drivers.md).
```
