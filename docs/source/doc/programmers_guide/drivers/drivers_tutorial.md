In this tutorial we want to guide you through the process of creating a new driver for an instrument you have in your lab.

The instrument we want to implement is a _Keithley Series 2400 SourceMeter_.
The instrument is connected to our computer via serial connection (RS232, GPIB, ...).

# 1. Create the Core Structure
To create the core structure use the _driver builder_. Open `CAMELS` and navigate to `Tools > Driver builder`.
